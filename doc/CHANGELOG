V0.15 2006-01-04
* The display for the title and download status no longer gets ugly when the 
  title is long. Now the download status will always be displayed, and the title 
  truncated
* 'Stopped' has been renamed to 'Cancelled' in order to be a bit clearer about
  what is really going on
* Added a 'Cancel all' menu item
* Added a status bar that indicates when the downloads are paused, this'll
  probably be used for more things in the future
V0.14 2005-12-29
* System tray icon, supports hiding/showing the window, quitting the program, 
  shows download status
* Application icon
* Added ability to defer events within the GUI, so that if the GUI hasn't yet 
  been displayed, messages or actions can be buffered until the GUI comes up
V0.13 2005-12-16:
* Fixed bug that made download of MP3s break (oops)
* Very minor change to how resuming is handled
V0.12 2005-11-28:
* Started keeping changelog
* Added ':' to characters that are converted to '_' to allow saving files on a 
  fat32 partition
* Better checking to see if the result of the HTTP request is actually an 
  attachment
* No longer allow the server to not resume if we are expecting it (this is 
  temporary, to allow something else to be fixed quickly)
* *.emp file filter used by default in open dialogue
