  (#67)
* Fixed that annoying flicker of the download status that was happening (#10)
* Added a 'pause all downloads' toolbar button
* Cancel/requeue buttons on downloads themselves
* [Naxos] cover art now saves with the base name 'album' by default
* [Naxos] added a 'Customer service' help menu entry

  just say 'failed' assuming the info is in the metafile
* Loading a metafile that contains information on an already existing download
  will cause the original one to be updated with the new info, and restart if
  appropriate.
* Try to reduce the chances that a .part file is left lying around
* [Naxos] increase the preferred download count to 4
* Add detection and notification of a network failure

V0.25
* Overhauled the filename cleaning stuff, hopefully finally fixing issues on
  windows. (#56)
* If the option 'spacesToUnderscore' is 'true' then spaces will be converted to
  underscores in filenames. (#55)
* Handle the case where the emusicj script is a symlink to the real location,
  and use that to find the program directory (#54)
V0.24
* Truncate the pathname to save files to if it gets too long on windows (which
  has stupidly low limits) (#49)
* Added option to allow the user to specify that they don't want cover art to
  be downloaded. This is done by adding the line 'downloadCoverArt=false' to
  ~/.emusicj/emusicj.props (#38)
* Updated build.xml to allow more flexible compiles, such as not always creating
  a dist build (#47)
V0.23

  started (#41)

  exists), defaulting to the first one if neither do
* [Reggae Country] added customisation for reggaecountry.com
* Fixed an infinite loop if the album/artist/track names contain a path
  wildcard (e.g. %t). Thanks to Hugh Brackett for spotting this one.
V0.22

  temp file names
* Changed default cover art name for windows and mac to 'folder.jpg'
* Cover art filename can be overridden by coverArtFilename option in
  prefs file

  crashing won't lose the current progress (#35)
* Added " and & to the stripped out characters, they may be causing issues
  on some file systems (#29 maybe)
V0.21
* Added patch by Michael MacDonald to give it support for eMusic's new .emx
  file format
V1.0 (Naxos only)
* [Naxos] Version bump of the Classicsonline version
V0.20-svn
* [Naxos] Added the macsrc directory which contains seperate code to support
  OpenDoc events on Mac OS X.
* [Naxos] Allowed 'save files as:' part of preferences to not be shown by 
  program varients.
* [Naxos] Fixed bug where program will crash if the 'save files as' field
  is too short.
* [Naxos] The XML download state root node name now comes from the strings
  factory.
* [Naxos] Built a windows builder/installer
* [Naxos] The downloader now detects if the server doesn't support resume, and
  if it doesn't, the download is restarted from the beginning.
* [Naxos] If this is the first launch, open the preferences window.
* [Naxos] Improved robustness of metafile type detection.
* [Naxos] Removed the undocumented browser configuration thing, added a much better
  way which will open the default browser on many platforms.
* [Naxos] Moved image creation to a factory, create an emusic/j one and 
  a naxos one.
* [Naxos] Moved version-specific strings to a class to aid in splitting the
  two versions
* [Naxos] Changed the system to use dependency injection using Guice
* [Naxos] Changed the formatting hints on the toolbar so that it doesn't look
  ugly in windows.
* [Naxos] Added build system to create a windows .exe
* [Naxos] Added a new metafile format that is like the .emp format, but
  without the encryption.
* Patch by Paul Focke to make the server URL in the .emp file respected. This
  is better for European users who now have their own server.
* Improved error handling in a few situations. Things that previously crashed
  the program should now cause it to display an error.
* Changed order of operations when a file download completes, previously it
  was 'rename file, close file'. This has been reversed in order to work
  on Windows.
V0.20 2006-09-03
* No longer use System.getenv(String) to get the http proxy value. Now it's
  passed into the program from the script via a -D declaration (the 'proper'
  way according to Sun). This means that it will work better with some JVMs.
V0.19 2006-08-28
* Added 'User Manual' option in help menu, which opens a browser (by
  default Firefox, this can be changed by using the 'undocumented'
  browserCommand option in the prefs file.)
* The update dialogue now offers to open a browser to the application
  homepage
* Updated SWT to stable 3.2 build
* Added option to automatically remove completed downloads from the
  downloads list. This happens 30 seconds after it finishes.
* Builds now use retroweaver to gain JDK1.4 compatibility. This means it
  works with GCJ, and probably other open JREs.
V0.18 2006-04-09
* Renamed 'None' to 'Clear' for the .emp drop for button, added a 'Clear' 
  button to the proxy settings
* Allowed proxy settings able to be cleared (fixes bug #14)
* Having * and ? in filenames seems to cause issues with some things, 
  these are now converted to '_'
* Refactored away some tedious boilerplate code for dealing with buttons
* Made the Proxy Host text box wider than the Proxy Port text box
* Renamed the 'Network' group to 'Proxy Settings'
* Added radio buttons to the proxy settings
* Remember last proxy host and port when proxy is turned off via radio buttons
* Removed the 'Clear' button in the proxy settings
* Http checks if proxy is active instead of if the host > 0 length
* Fixed ugly MIME handling in download code, now it's a lot more generalised
V0.17 2006-02-06
* Added new set of icons, from Liron Tocker <http://lironbot.com>
* About text box now has a scrollbar (fixes bug #7), changed the look of
  it a bit to include new app logo
* System tray icon now changes when all downloads are paused (fixes bug #8)
* When eMusic/J is opened, any downloads that had failed will now be tried
  again (fixes #11)
* Requeuing a track resets its download failure count (fixes #11)
* 'Finished' has been renamed to 'Completed' (fixes #12)
* Pause/resume downloads from system tray icon (fixes #9)
V0.16 2006-01-15
* New downloads aren't added to the list if they're already on it.
* If a download fails 5 times, it won't be automatically started again
* Refactored the display of extra information (in the info panel) to be
  much more general, to allow more things to be displayed
* Album covers now show the cover when they are selected
* Genre and duration now show for tracks in the info panel
* Added 'undocumented' option "noServer" to preferences. If the line:
  noServer=1
  is added to ~/.emusicj/emusicj.props then the client/server business won't
  happen, which will lead to faster startup on the machines that it doesn't 
  work on.
* Drop directory support now works. The program will monitor a specified 
  directory and autoload any .emp files that end up in there.
V0.15 2006-01-04
* The display for the title and download status no longer gets ugly when the 
  title is long. Now the download status will always be displayed, and the title 
  truncated
* 'Stopped' has been renamed to 'Cancelled' in order to be a bit clearer about
  what is really going on
* Added a 'Cancel all' menu item
* Added a status bar that indicates when the downloads are paused, this'll
  probably be used for more things in the future
V0.14 2005-12-29
* System tray icon, supports hiding/showing the window, quitting the program, 
  shows download status
* Application icon
* Added ability to defer events within the GUI, so that if the GUI hasn't yet 
  been displayed, messages or actions can be buffered until the GUI comes up
V0.13 2005-12-16:
* Fixed bug that made download of MP3s break (oops)
* Very minor change to how resuming is handled
V0.12 2005-11-28:
* Started keeping changelog
* Added ':' to characters that are converted to '_' to allow saving files on a 
  fat32 partition
* Better checking to see if the result of the HTTP request is actually an 
  attachment
* No longer allow the server to not resume if we are expecting it (this is 
  temporary, to allow something else to be fixed quickly)
* *.emp file filter used by default in open dialogue
