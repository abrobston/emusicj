V0.19-SVN
* Added 'User Manual' option in help menu, which opens a browser (by
  default Firefox, this can be changed by using the 'undocumented'
  browserCommand option in the prefs file.)
* Updated SWT to stable 3.2 build
* Added option to automatically remove completed downloads from the
  downloads list. This happens 30 seconds after it finishes.
* Builds now use retroweaver to gain JDK1.4 compatibility. This means it
  works with GCJ, and probably other open JREs.
V0.18 2006-04-09
* Renamed 'None' to 'Clear' for the .emp drop for button, added a 'Clear' 
  button to the proxy settings
* Allowed proxy settings able to be cleared (fixes bug #14)
* Having * and ? in filenames seems to cause issues with some things, 
  these are now converted to '_'
* Refactored away some tedious boilerplate code for dealing with buttons
* Made the Proxy Host text box wider than the Proxy Port text box
* Renamed the 'Network' group to 'Proxy Settings'
* Added radio buttons to the proxy settings
* Remember last proxy host and port when proxy is turned off via radio buttons
* Removed the 'Clear' button in the proxy settings
* Http checks if proxy is active instead of if the host > 0 length
* Fixed ugly MIME handling in download code, now it's a lot more generalised
V0.17 2006-02-06
* Added new set of icons, from Liron Tocker <http://lironbot.com>
* About text box now has a scrollbar (fixes bug #7), changed the look of
  it a bit to include new app logo
* System tray icon now changes when all downloads are paused (fixes bug #8)
* When eMusic/J is opened, any downloads that had failed will now be tried
  again (fixes #11)
* Requeuing a track resets its download failure count (fixes #11)
* 'Finished' has been renamed to 'Completed' (fixes #12)
* Pause/resume downloads from system tray icon (fixes #9)
V0.16 2006-01-15
* New downloads aren't added to the list if they're already on it.
* If a download fails 5 times, it won't be automatically started again
* Refactored the display of extra information (in the info panel) to be
  much more general, to allow more things to be displayed
* Album covers now show the cover when they are selected
* Genre and duration now show for tracks in the info panel
* Added 'undocumented' option "noServer" to preferences. If the line:
  noServer=1
  is added to ~/.emusicj/emusicj.props then the client/server business won't
  happen, which will lead to faster startup on the machines that it doesn't 
  work on.
* Drop directory support now works. The program will monitor a specified 
  directory and autoload any .emp files that end up in there.
V0.15 2006-01-04
* The display for the title and download status no longer gets ugly when the 
  title is long. Now the download status will always be displayed, and the title 
  truncated
* 'Stopped' has been renamed to 'Cancelled' in order to be a bit clearer about
  what is really going on
* Added a 'Cancel all' menu item
* Added a status bar that indicates when the downloads are paused, this'll
  probably be used for more things in the future
V0.14 2005-12-29
* System tray icon, supports hiding/showing the window, quitting the program, 
  shows download status
* Application icon
* Added ability to defer events within the GUI, so that if the GUI hasn't yet 
  been displayed, messages or actions can be buffered until the GUI comes up
V0.13 2005-12-16:
* Fixed bug that made download of MP3s break (oops)
* Very minor change to how resuming is handled
V0.12 2005-11-28:
* Started keeping changelog
* Added ':' to characters that are converted to '_' to allow saving files on a 
  fat32 partition
* Better checking to see if the result of the HTTP request is actually an 
  attachment
* No longer allow the server to not resume if we are expecting it (this is 
  temporary, to allow something else to be fixed quickly)
* *.emp file filter used by default in open dialogue
