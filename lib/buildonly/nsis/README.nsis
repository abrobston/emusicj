This directory contains a System.dll which contains more functions than that 
included in Debian and Ubuntu, due to compilation issues on GCC. It should be 
copied into /usr/share/nsis/Plugins (after apt-get install nsis), overwriting 
the pre-existing one to allow the windows installer to be built on Linux.
